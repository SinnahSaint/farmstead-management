## Notes to Self: 

I need "People(static-ish info)", "Activities(static-ish info)", "Tasks"(assigned activities), and "Events(completed tasks, etc)".

be brave. branch it, butcher it, back it up.

## ToDo

# Once all that is done:
  * check all the forms to see if they have all the necessary/desired fields
  * check the validations/permits so that everything can go through
  * look at the javascript & css again and make the forms pretty.
  * css libraries/frameworks make that easier. (look at boodstrap, tailwind, etc)
