# farmstead-management
Did you milk the cow? Is she still producing as well as last year? How much money did you spend on chicken feed last year? The year before? How does that compare to egg production? Is the weather a factor? 

All of these are really interesting questions, but unless you have the data, there's no way to know. Writing everything out by hand isn't searchable and is a pain to analyse. That said, any overly complicated solution won't be used. 

That's why I'm building this farmstead management system. It will be simple enough that those who just need to know if their wife ordered more chicken feed before leaving for work gets a great use out of it, but expandable enough to tackle the folks who need to delegate tasks to hired help before heading out to the farmers market.
